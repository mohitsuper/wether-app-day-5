🌤️ Title: Weather App – Day 5 | Zero to Hero Coding Challenge
📝 Description:
Day 5 of my #ZeroToHero coding journey! 🚀
I built a functional and responsive Weather App using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, allowing users to search for any city and instantly view its current temperature, name, and weather icon.

✅ Key Features:
🌐 Real-time weather data via API

🔍 Search by city name

📷 Dynamic weather icon based on condition

🌡️ Temperature displayed in °C

🎯 Error handling for invalid city names

🛠️ Tech Used: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
